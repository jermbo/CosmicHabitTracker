# Habit Tracker

I am trying to figure out how best utilize generative AI in my projects. Figured a simple habit tracker could be a good place to start. Nothing to complicated to do my own, but difficult enough to test the AI. I will attempt to build the same project in React, Vue, and Angular as these are tools I use regularly. As time and interest permits, I might try other frameworks like, Alpine, Solid, and Svelte to see what that gets me.
